Int per Crit @ 60
	Mages have a 0.2% base spell crit rate, and 1% crit per 59.5 int
	Priests have a 0.8% base spell crit rate, and 1% crit per 59.5 int
	Warlocks have a 1.7% base spell crit rate, and 1% crit per 60.6 int
	Druids have a 1.8% base spell crit rate, and 1% crit per 60 int
	Shaman have a 2.3% base spell crit rate, and 1% crit per 59.2 int
	Paladins have 0% base, and 1% crit per 29.5 int
For levels lower then 60 TC will use your melee crit rate divided by your melee crit rate @ 60, multiplied by your int per crit @ 60.
This should be very accurate, as I'm sure they follow the same patterns.  If your attack rating is too low to show a melee crit rate
TC will use a linear relationship.

Agi per Crit			= Calculated from your crit rate (modified by your attack rating), until 60 where
				  it uses predefined values.
Crit % for Hunters		= Melee Crit Rate (from attack tooltip, modified by attack rating) + Lethal Shots

Crit Bonus			= (Average Crit Damage / Average Hit (not inc crits)) - 1

+Damage Coefficient		= All +Damage Coefficients are hardcoded in to theorycraft.  Reason behind this
				  is because there is no hard and fast rule for determining the coefficient.
				  Also if they were not, spells like Presence of Mind would alter the coefficient
				  when activated (via changing the cast time).
				  By default, talents that modify your spell damage will be multiplied by the
				  +Damage Coefficient.  Eg, 5/5 firepower will make fireball get 110% of your +dam.
				  Some spells are hardcoded to not have talents applied on gear, this is from
				  testing in game.  Eg curse of agony, drain life, every healing spell :).
				  If you find any spells which have the wrong coefficient, or have talents applied
				  when they shouldn't (or vice versa), let me know what the correct relationship is
				  on the Curse Gaming Theorycraft comments section :) Thanks!
